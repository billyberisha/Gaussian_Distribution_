# Gaussian Code 



This exercise includes a file called 'numbers.txt'.
The 'numbers.txt' file is read in by the read_data_file() method. 

Gaussian Distribution Formulas
probability density function

f(x | μ, σ^2) = (1 / √(2πσ^2)) * e^(-(x-μ)^2 / (2σ^2))

where μ = mean
σ = standard deviation
σ^2 = variance

mean = μ= n*p (n-number of tries, p-probability)
variance = σ^2 = n*p*(1-p)
standard deviation = σ = sqrt(σ^2)

probability densituu function: f(k|n|p) = (n!/(k!(n-k)!) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
